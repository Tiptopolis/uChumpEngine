Personal prototyping junk.

Using Libgdx as a base, I am trying to copy some of the kewl shit i see other software do.
Mostly stuck in to UI for now, with some other basic stuff in the background. This is all to aid my 
personal learning path.

I'll have you know that I've no idea what I'm doing at any point in time, but that I am working slowly 
towards a grand vision of a world simulation. I learned Java in my spare time at work, so please point out 
any obvious beginner nitpicks. If it works, it works, though I'll gladly take any advice for improvement
and optimization.

Github is the logical next-step on this path.

I am trying to avoid prebuilt libraries, though there are obvious advantages for some.
I will occasionally adopt one to study and experiment with its features before trying to 
copy it, or at least streamline its usage in the scope of my projects.

I havn't given much thought to end-user utility, so more power to you if you can make use of it.
Some of this is direct copypasta from other places.

using: Eclipse

Gdx- for the basic openGL stuff & input features

Guice- for dependency injection

Ashley and Artemis- ECS experimentation

=============================================================================

4-function Calculator GUI - done, expand to full-feature basic calculator
World-Map- working on handler to control camera movement, working examples exist to copy




I also need to learn how to better use GitHub for this.
